//"Over the past Sukrina, I have contributed to the development and maintenance of 
// back-end systems with a focus on reliability, scalability, and clean code practices. 
// I have worked extensively with [Node.js/Express, MongoDB, etc.], and I continue to deepen
//  my understanding of RESTful API development, database design, and authentication mechanismsOne 
// of my key achievements was [briefly mention a project or feature youâ€™re proud of â€” e.g., "building a s
// ervice management API that improved response time by 30%"]. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and 
// following best practices for security and performance.I've also collaborated closely with front-end developers and QA testers to
//  ensure smooth integration and deployment. I'm comfortable using Git for version control, Postman for testing, and cloud platforms like 
// MongoDB Atlas.In the future, I aim to improve my skills in areas like automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and system design. I'm also 
// interested in contributing more to architectural 
// decisions and taking ownership of more complex back-end modules//~~
